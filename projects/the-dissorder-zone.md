  This project shines a spotlight on OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and
  other mental health disorders. I took an opportunity this year to try
  something different. In this project, I challenge the conventional
  'perfectionism' so prevalent in today’s architecture by putting the dirtiness
  of nature on a pedestal. This project argues that dirtiness can be beautiful
  and healing.
